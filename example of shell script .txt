 LInux scrpting 
 ====================
https://linuxhint.com/30_bash_script_examples/

no-1 : hello world print script 
=====
#!/bin/bash
echo "hello world"

No-2 : Two number add shell scripting 
=========
#!/bin/bash
((sum=34+67))
echo $sum

No-3 : use while loop
=======
In the example, while loop will iterate for 5 times. The value of count variable will increment by 1 in each step.
When the value of count variable will 5 then the while loop will terminate.

#!/bin/bash
valid=true
count=1
while [ $valid ]
do
echo $count
if [ $count -eq 5 ];
then
break
fi
((count++))
done

No-4 :  multiline 
========
#!/bin/bash
: '
The following script calculates
the square value of the number, 5.
'
((area=5*5))
echo $area

No-5: using for loop 
========
Here, for loop will iterate for 10 times and print all values of the variable, counter in single line.

#!/bin/bash
for (( counter=10; counter>0; counter-- ))
do
echo -n "$counter "
done
printf "\n"


NO-6 :Get User Input:
========
one string value will be taken from the user and display the value by combining other string value

#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter Your Name"
read name
echo "Welcome $name to LinuxHint"

No-7 :Using if statement:
=======
Here, 10 is assigned to the variable, n. 
if the value of $n is less than 10 then the output will be “It is a one digit number”, otherwise the output will be “It is a two digit number”. 
For comparison, ‘-lt’ is used here.For comparison, you can also use ‘-eq’ for equality, ‘-ne’ for not equality and ‘-gt’ for greater than in bash script.

#!/bin/bash
n=10
if [ $n -lt 10 ];
then
echo "It is a one digit number"
else
echo "It is a two digit number"
fi

#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter your n "
rean n
if [ $n -lt 10 ];
then
echo "It is a one digit number"
echo "It is a two digit number"
fi
